Discover why spiritual warfare exists Understand how Satan s kingdom operates Learn the six weapons of spiritual warfare Implement strategies that will bind Satan s schemes Tap into the overcoming power of the Holy Spirit Satan has already declared war on God s kingdom.

Unfortunately, many Christians are unaware that Satan also has a kingdom, represented by a host of demons. With earth as the battlefield, these two kingdoms wage war with one another for our minds and souls. As Christians, we need to understand the nature of this war and how Satan s kingdom operates. Legendary author and Bible teacher Derek Prince examines the concept of spiritual warfare as an unmistakable aspect of Christian living. Thanks to this crucial teaching, you will... Discover why spiritual warfare exists Understand how Satan s kingdom operates Learn the six weapons of spiritual warfare Implement strategies that will bind Satan s schemes Tap into the overcoming power of the Holy Spirit Satan has already declared war on God s kingdom. As citizens of God s kingdom, we have no choice; we are already at war.

Although its remarkable capabilities have made Ruby on Rails one of the world’s most popular web development frameworks, it can be challenging to learn and use. Ruby on Rails™ Tutorial, Second Edition, is the solution. Best-selling author and leading Rails developer Michael Hartl teaches Rails by guiding you through the development of your own complete sample application using the latest techniques in Rails web development. The updates to this edition include all-new site design using Twitter’s Bootstrap; coverage of the new asset pipeline, including Sprockets and Sass; behavior-driven development (BDD) with Capybara and RSpec; better automated testing with Guard and Spork; roll your own authentication with has_secure_password; and an introduction to Gherkin and Cucumber.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou’ll find integrated tutorials not only for Rails, but also for the essential Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL skills you’ll need when developing web applications. Hartl explains how each new technique solves a real-world problem, and he demonstrates this with bite-sized code that’s simple enough to understand, yet novel enough to be useful. Whatever your previous web development experience, this book will guide you to true Rails mastery.", "author"=>"Michael Hartl "}, "commit"=>"Update Book", "id"=>"5"}

But no matter how great a destiny God has in view for you, you will need faith to make it a reality!\r\n\r\nFaith is the guarantee of your victory over the forces of sickness, disease, poverty and wickedness of any cadre; without it salvation is a farce, a sham and a mockery, devoid of the power you need to make things happen! That is why Dr. David Oyedepo (a man commissioned to liberate the world through the preaching of the word of faith) set out to write this book, to deliver to you practical steps to operating faith and getting results. In this book therefore you will hear him say:\r\n\r\n“Faith is not just a mere confession; it is a great profession.  It is not just saying what God says; it is doing what God says.”\r\n\r\n“When faith is at work, the power of God is connected, which makes all things possible. Faith is your access to the power of God, not tears!  Without faith nothing gets done!”\r\n\r\n“Faith is not a philosophical fact; neither is it an intellectual fact; faith is a spiritual force, drawn from the living word to produce living proofs.”", "author"=>"Bishop David Oyedepo"}, "commit"=>"Update Book", "id"=>"19"}
